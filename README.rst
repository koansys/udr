udr
================

A Unicode Dict Reader in the spirit of csv.DictReader that recodes
lines in UTF-8. It mostly extends the csv UnicodeReader from the
python csv docs and makes it a dict reader.

Thanks go to the authors of csv, csv.DictReader and the csv doc author.

Please see docs/index.rst for the documentation.
